## Example

```js
import request from 'superagent'
import Chan from './imageboard'

const chan = Chan('4chan', {
  request(method, url, parameters) {
    // Sends an HTTP request.
    // Any HTTP request library can be used here.
    // Must return a `Promise` resolving to response JSON.
    switch (method) {
      case 'POST':
        return request.post(url).send(parameters)
      case 'GET':
        return request.get(url)
      default:
        throw new Error('Not supported')
    }
  }
})

// Get the list of boards.
chan.getBoards().then((boards) => console.log(boards))

// Get the list of threads on "/a/" board.
chan.getThreads({ boardId: 'a' }).then((threads) => console.log(threads))

// Get thread info and comments list for thread "12345" on "/a/" board.
chan.getThread({ boardId: 'a', threadId: 12345 }).then((thread) => console.log(thread))
```

## `Chan`

To use the package first construct a `Chan` instance using the default exported function.

```js
import Chan from './imageboard'
```

### `Chan(chanIdOrChanConfig, options)`

The default exported function, creates a new `Chan` instance.

If a `chanId` is supported by the library out-of-the-box (see the `./chan` directory) then such `chanId` can be passed as a string. Otherwise, `chanConfig` object should be supplied.

`chanId`s supported out-of-the-box:

* `"2ch"`
* `"4chan"`
* `"8ch"`
* `"kohlchan"`
* `"lainchan"`
* `"arisuchan"`
* `"endchan"`

See [Chan config](#chan-config) for the available `chanConfig` properties.

Available `options`:

* `request(method: string, url: string, parameters: object?): Promise` — (required) Sends HTTP requests to chan API. Must return a `Promise` resolving to response JSON. Example: `request("GET", "https://8ch.net/boards.json")`.

* `commentUrl: string?` — (optional) A template for the `url` of all `type: "post-link"`s (links to other comments) in parsed comments' `content`. Is `"/{boardId}/{threadId}#{commentId}"` by default.

* `messages: object?` — (optional) "Messages" ("strings", "labels") used when parsing comments `content`. There're no defaults so these should be passed even for English. Messages used for quoted comment links: `deletedComment: "Deleted comment"`, `hiddenComment: "Hidden comment"`, `quotedComment: "Comment"`. Messages used in autogenerated quotes: `video: "Video"`, `picture: "Picture"`, `audio: "Audio"`, `attachment: "Attachment"`, `code: "Code"`, `link: "Link"`, `linkTo: "Link to"`.

* `censoredWords: object[]?` — (optional) An array of pre-compiled word filters which can be used for censoring certain words in parsed comments' `content` or `title`. See the [Censorship](#censorship) section of this README.

* `commentLengthLimit` — (optional) A `number` telling the maximum comment length (in "points" which can be thought of as "characters and character equivalents for non-text content") upon exceeding which a preview is generated for a comment (as `comment.contentPreview`).

* `useRelativeUrls` — (optional) Determines whether to use relative or absolute URLs for attachments. Relative URLs are for the cases when a chan is temporarily hosted on an alternative domain and so all attachments are too meaning that the default chan domain name shouldn't be present in attachment URLs. Is `false` by default.

* `parseContent` — (optional) Can be set to `false` to skip parsing comment HTML (except for the "opening" post of the thread which is always parsed up-front because it makes sense). The rationale is that when there're 500-some comments in a thread parsing all of them can take up to a second on a modern CPU which results in a subpar user experience. By deferring parsing comment HTML an application can first only parse, say, the first 10 comments' HTML and only when the page has been loaded it can proceed to parsing the rest of the comments (maybe even just the next 10 comments until the user scrolls down). If `parseContent` is set to `false` then each non-empty comment will have `content` being an HTML string. If `parseContent` is set to `false` then also `thread.title` won't be autogenerated when it's missing. `Chan.parseCommentContent(comment, { boardId, threadId })` method can be used to parse comment content later.

<!--
* `parseContentText` — (optional) Set to `true` to also parse `contentText` when parsing `content`. This can be used, for example, for full-text search.
-->

* `expandReplies` — (optional) Set to `true` to expand the optional `comment.replies[]` array from a list of comment ids to the list of the actual comment objects.

## `Chan` methods

### `getBoards(options)`

Returns a list of [Boards](#board). For some imageboards this isn't gonna be a full list of boards because, for example, `8ch.net` has about `20,000` boards so `getBoards()` returns just the "top 20 boards" list.

### `getAllBoards(options)`

Returns a list of all [Boards](#board). For example, `8ch.net` has about `20,000` boards so `getBoards()` returns just the "top 20 boards" list while `getAllBoards()` returns all `20,000` boards.

### `getThreads({ boardId }, options)`

Returns a list of [Threads](#thread).

### `getThread({ boardId, threadId }, options)`

Returns a [Thread](#thread).

### `parseCommentContent(comment, { boardId, threadId })`

Parses `comment` content if `parseContent: false` option was used when creating a `Chan` instance.

## Content

A post can have `content` and sometimes `contentPreview` both of which are [`Content`](https://github.com/catamphetamine/webapp-frontend/tree/master/src/utility/post/PostContent.md).

## Attachment

An attachment can be a:

* [`Picture`](https://github.com/catamphetamine/webapp-frontend/tree/master/src/utility/post/PostAttachments.md#picture) attachment

<!--
Additional fields:

```js
{
  // (only for `2ch.hk`)
  // `true` in case of a `2ch.hk` sticker.
  sticker: boolean?
}
```
-->

* [`Video`](https://github.com/catamphetamine/webapp-frontend/tree/master/src/utility/post/PostAttachments.md#video) attachment

```

## Censorship

A `censoredWords` option can be passed to the `Chan` function to censor certain words in parsed comments' `content` or `title`. The `censoredWords: object[]?` option must be a list of word filters pre-compiled via the exported `compileWordPatterns(censoredWords, language)` function:

* `language: string` — (required) A lowercase two-letter language code (examples: `"en"`, `"ru"`, `"de"`) and is only used to generate a regular expression for splitting text into individual words.

* `censoredWords: string[]` — (required) An array of `string` word patterns. The standard regular expression syntax applies, `^` meaning "word start", `$` meaning "word end", `.` meaning "any letter", etc. The patterns are applied to each individual word and if there's a match then the whole word is censored.

Word pattern examples:

* `^mother.*` — Matches `"mothercare"` and `"motherfather"`.

* `^mother[f].*` — Matches `"motherfather"` but not `"mothercare"`.

* `^mother[^f].*` — Matches `"mothercare"` but not `"motherfather"`.

* `^cock$` — Matches `"cock"` in `"my cock is big"` but won't match `"cocktail"` or `"peacock"`.

* `cock` — Matches `"cock"`, `"cocktail"` and `"peacock"`.

* `cock$` — Matches `"cock"` and `"peacock"` but not `"cocktail"` .

* `^cocks?` — Matches `"cock"` and `"cocks"`.

* `^cock.{0,3}` — Matches `"cock"`, `"cocks"`, `"cocker"`, `"cockers"`.

## Chan config

```js
{
  // (required)
  // Chan unique ID.
  "id": "4chan",

  // (required)
  // Chan website domain name.
  "domain": "4chan.org",

  // (required)
  // The engine the chan runs on.
  // Must be supported out-of-the-box (see the `./engine` directory).
  // Supported engines:
  // * `"4chan"`
  // * `"vichan"`
  // * `"OpenIB"`
  // * `"lynxchan"`
  // * `"makaba"`
  "engine": "vichan",

  // (required)
  // A template for parsing links to other comments in comment HTML.
  // The first "group" must match board id,
  // the second "group" must match thread id,
  // the third "group" must match comment id.
  "commentUrlParser": "^\\/(.+?)\\/res\\/(\\d+).html#(\\d+)$"

  // (optional)
  // Attachment URL template.
  // Is required for chan engines that don't
  // provide the full attachment URL (`vichan`)
  // or for chans that host attachments on another domain
  // (`4chan` hosts attachments at `https://i.4cdn.org`).
  // Available parameters are:
  // * boardId — Board ID ("b", etc).
  // * name — Attachment filename on server.
  // * originalName — Original attachment filename, is used for non-image file attachments.
  // * ext — "." character plus attachment file extension.
  "attachmentUrl": "https://i.4cdn.org/{boardId}/{name}{ext}",

  // (optional)
  // Attachment thumbnail URL pattern.
  // Same as "attachmentUrl" but for thumbnails.
  "attachmentThumbnailUrl": "https://i.4cdn.org/{boardId}/{name}s.jpg",

  // (optional)
  // Chans usually store images/videos under random-generated filenames
  // and all other files under their original filename,
  // hence the separate "fileAttachmentUrl" parameter.
  "fileAttachmentUrl": "https://i.4cdn.org/{boardId}/{originalName}{ext}",

  // (is only required by `8ch.net`)
  // `8ch.net` has `fpath: 0/1` parameter for attachments:
  // `fpath: 1` attachments are hosted at the global
  // board-agnostic URLs (not having `{boardId}` as part of their URL)
  // and all other attachments are hosted at board-specific URLs.
  "attachmentUrlFpath": "https://media.8ch.net/file_store/{name}{ext}",

  // (is only required by `8ch.net`)
  // Attachment thumbnail URL pattern for `fpath: 1` attachments.
  // Same as "attachmentUrlFpath" but for thumbnails.
  "attachmentThumbnailUrlFpath": "https://media.8ch.net/file_store/{name}{ext}",

  // (optional)
  // Most chans set author name to some default placeholder
  // like "Anonymous" when no author name has been input.
  // The parser then checks if author name is equal to the
  // "defaultAuthorName" and if it is then it leaves the `authorName` blank.
  // Can be a string or an object of shape `{ boardId: defaultAuthorName }`.
  "defaultAuthorName": "Anonymous",
  // or on a per-board basis:
  // "defaultAuthorName": {
  //  "*": "Anonymous",
  //  "ru": "Аноним",
  //  "christan": "Christanon"
  // }

  // (optional)
  // Thumbnail size. Is required for `lynxchan`.
  // `lynxchan` engine currently has a bug:
  // it doesn't provide thumbnail dimensions.
  // To work around that bug, thumbnail dimensions
  // are derived from the original image aspect ratio.
  "thumbnailSize": 255
}
```

## Adding a new chan

* Create the chan's directory in `./src/imageboard/chan`.
* Create `index.json` and `index.js` files in the chan's directory (see other chans as an example). See [Chan config](#chan-config) for the explanation of the `index.json` file format.
* Add an export for the chan in `./src/imageboard/chan/index.js` (same as for the existing chans).

If the chan runs on an already supported engine then it most likely has its own comment HTML syntax which could be different from other chans running on the same engine. In such case, go to the engine directory (`./src/imageboard/engine/${engineName}`) and edit `index.js` file to use the set of ["comment parser plugins"](#comment-parser-plugins) specific to this new chan (see other chan's comment parser plugins as an example). Otherwise, if it's a new engine:

* Create the engine directory in `./src/imageboard/engine`.
* Create `index.js` file in the engine directory (same as for the existing engines). The engine class must extend `./src/imageboard/Engine.js` and implement at least four methods (`parseBoards()`, `parseThreads()`, `parseThread()` and `parseComment()`) and also provide a list of HTML ["comment parser plugins"](#comment-parser-plugins) (see other engines as an example).
* Add the engine in `./src/imageboard/engine/index.js` file (same as for the existing engines).

## Comment parser plugins

Chan comments are formatted in HTML. Different chans use their own comment HTML syntax. For example, bold text could be `<strong>bold</strong>` at some chans, `<b>bold</b>` at other chans and `<span class="bold">bold</span>` at the other chans, even if they all used the same engine. Hence, every chan requires defining their own set of "comment parser plugins" in `./src/imageboard/engine/${engine}` directory.

A "comment parser plugin" is an object having properties:

* `tag: String` — HTML tag (in lower case).
* `attributes: object[]?` — A set of HTML tag attribute filters. An attribute filter is an object of shape `{ name: String, value: String }`.
* `createBlock(content: PostContent, node, options): PostContent?` — Receives child `content` and wraps it in a parent content block (see [Post Content](https://github.com/catamphetamine/webapp-frontend/blob/master/src/utility/post/PostContent.md) docs). Can return `undefined`. Can return a string, an object or an array of strings or objects. `node` is the DOM `Node` and provides methods like `getAttribute(name: String)`. `options` is an object providing some configuration options like `commentUrlParser` for parsing comment links (`<a href="/b/123#456">&gt;&gt;456</a>`).

Example:

```html
<strong>bold <span class="italic">text</span></strong>
```

Plugins:

```js
const parseBold = {
  tag: 'strong',
  createBlock(content) {
    return {
      type: 'text',
      style: 'bold',
      content
    }
  }
}

const parseItalic = {
  tag: 'span',
  attributes: [{
    name: 'class',
    value: 'italic'
  }],
  createBlock(content) {
    return {
      type: 'text',
      style: 'italic',
      content
    }
  }
}

export default [
  parseBold,
  parseItalic
]
```

Result:

```js
[
  [
    {
      type: 'text',
      style: 'bold',
      content: [
        'bold ',
        {
          type: 'text',
          style: 'italic',
          content: 'text'
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
]
```
