```

### createParser(chanIdOrChanSettings, options)

Creates a new parser instance.

If a `chanId` is supported by the library out-of-the-box (has an entry in `chan` directory) then those pre-configured `chanSettings` are used. Otherwise, `chanSettings` should be supplied.

`chanId`s supported out-of-the-box:

* `"2ch"`
* `"4chan"`
* `"8ch"`
* `"kohlchan"`

Available `chanSettings`:

* `id` — (optional) Chan identifier that could be used to differentiate between different chans using the same parser. For example, `4chan.org` parser is compatible with `8ch.net` and the small differences are handled as `if (id === "8ch") { ... } else { ... }`.
* `commentUrlRegExp` — (required) A `string` used to parse "in reply to" comment ids from comment HTML content to populate `comment.inReplyTo` arrays.
* `defaultAuthorName` — (optional) Can be a `string` or an object of shape `{ boardId: defaultName }` where `boardId === "*"` means "any other board". Default author name is used to determine whether a comment's `authorName` should be set to `undefined` instead of a dummy string value (for example, `"Anonymous"`).
* `attachmentUrl` — (required for `"4chan"` parser) A `string` having variables: `{boardId}`, `{name}`, `{originalName}`, `{ext}`.
* `attachmentThumbnailUrl` — (required for `"4chan"` parser) Same as `attachmentUrl` but for the thumbnail.
* `fileAttachmentUrl` — (optional) Can be present if file attachment URLs are different from generic attachment URLs for some reason (for example, `4chan.org` hosts file attachments using their "original names" instead of autogenerated ones as it does for pictures).
* `attachmentUrlFpath` — (is only used by `8ch.net`) `8ch.net` has `fpath: 0/1` parameter for attachments: `fpath` attachments are hosted at the global board-agnostic `fpath` URLs (not having `boardId` as part of their URL) and all other attachments are hosted at board-specific URLs.
* `attachmentThumbnailUrlFpath` — (is only used by `8ch.net`) Thumnail for `attachmentUrlFpath`.
* `parser` — (optional) In case of parsing a chan which isn't supported out-of-the-box `parser` string can be passed to tell the library to use a specific parser for parsing the chan. Example: `"4chan"`.

Available `options`:

* `getUrl(board, thread, comment)` — (required) `chan-parser` transforms all links to posts and threads by replacing their URLs (for example, `http://boards.4channel.org/v/thread/467643418#q467643687`) with custom URLs generated by this `getUrl()` function (for example, `/v/467643418#467643687`).

* `messages` — (optional) `messages` are mostly used for setting post link content. Examples: `messages.deletedPost === "Comment deleted"`, `messages.hiddenPost === "Hidden comment"`, `messages.quotedPost === "Comment"`.

* `filters` — (optional) An array of filters used for censoring certain words in comments' content or subject. Filters should be pre-compiled via `compileFilters(filters, language)`. `language` argument can be either `"en"` or `"ru"` (more languages can be added) and is only used for finding word boundaries. `filters` argument must be an array of `string` patterns. The standard regular expression syntax applies (`^` meaning "word start", `$` meaning "word end", `.` meaning "any letter", etc). Example: `^mother.*$`, `fc?uck`.

* `commentLengthLimit` — (optional) A `number` telling the maximum comment length (in "points" which can be thought of as "characters and character equivalents for non-text content") upon exceeding which a preview is generated for a comment (as `comment.contentPreview`).

* `useRelativeUrls` — (optional) (is only used by `2ch` parser) Determines whether to use relative or absolute URLs for attachments. Relative URLs are for the cases when a chan is temporarily hosted on an alternative domain and so all attachments are too meaning that the default chan domain name shouldn't be present in attachment URLs.

* `parseContent` — (optional) Can be set to `false` to skip parsing comment HTML (except for the "opening" post of the thread which is always parsed up-front because it makes sense). The rationale is that when there're 500-some comments in a thread parsing all of them can take up to a second on a modern CPU which results in a subpar user experience. By deferring parsing comment HTML an application can first only parse, say, the first 10 comments' HTML and only when the page has been loaded it can proceed to parsing the rest of the comments (maybe even just the next 10 comments until the user scrolls down). If `parseContent` is set to `false` then each comment will have `.parseContent()` method that should be called to parse comment content on demand.

* `addOnContentChange` — (optional) Adds `onContentChange()` functions to each comment. The `onContentChange()` function should be called whenever the comment content is updated (for example, after a link to a YouTube video is parsed and expanded into an embedded attachment). It re-generates comment preview and also if `expandReplies` is `true` it updates the autogenerated quotes in the comment's replies. Returns an array of ids of replies to this comment whos content did change as a result of this comment content's change. For example, when there're replies to this comment having autogenerated quotes those quotes should be re-generated when this comment's content changes.

* `expandReplies` — (optional) Set to `true` to expand the optional `comment.replies[]` array from a list of comment ids to the list of the actual comment objects.

### Parser.parseBoards(apiResponse)

Parses a list of [Boards](#board).

```js
{
	boards: Board[],
	// (optional)
	boardsByPopularity: Board[],
	// (optional)
	boardsByCategory: {
		'Category': Board[],
		...
	}
}
```

### Parser.parseThreads(apiResponse, { boardId })

Parses board contents. Returns a list of [Threads](#thread).


### Parser.parseThread(apiResponse, { boardId })

Parses a thread (having a list of [comments](#comment)). Returns a [Thread](#thread).

## Content

A post can have `content` and sometimes `contentPreview` both of which are [`Content`](https://github.com/catamphetamine/webapp-frontend/tree/master/src/utility/post/PostContent.md).

## Attachment

An attachment can be a:

* [`Picture`](https://github.com/catamphetamine/webapp-frontend/tree/master/src/utility/post/PostAttachments.md#picture) attachment

Additional fields:

```js
{
	// (only for `2ch.hk`)
