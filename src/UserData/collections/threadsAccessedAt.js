// Stores "latest accessed at" timestamps for threads.
// Archived threads that haven't been accessed for a while
// get cleaned up from User Data (including this collection).
//
// Some providers have a concept of "archived" threads.
// "Archived" threads are usually old/locked/expired ones
// that may or may not be scheduled for deletion.
//
// Deleted threads are called "expired" threads.
//
// For example, some imageboards keep threads, that've been
// pushed off by newer ones, for some time (for example, a couple of days).
// When such thread is detected to have been pushed off,
// it's marked as "archived" with the current timestamp
// as its "archived at" date.
// The precise "archived at" date can usually be known
// when fetching a "get thread comments" API response
// if a user navigates to such thread's page.
//
// The automatic clean-up is set up to clear threads
// that've been archived (or deleted) for a long time.
// During such clean-up, all references to such thread
// in other collections are deleted too, excluding the cases
// when a collection is defined with `clearOnExpire: false`.
//
// The timestamp is in days rather than seconds.
// (just to save on storage space)
//
// Example: `threadsAccessedAt/a/123 = 12345`.
