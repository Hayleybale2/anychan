// (including the "original comment" of the thread)
//
// If a comment has been fully shown on the screen,
// it's marked as "read", so that next time the user
// opens this thread, it would show only the comments
// starting from the first non-"read" one.
// This way, the user doesn't have to scroll to the bottom
// every time they open a thread to read new comments.
//
// Example: `latestReadComments/a/123 = 125`.
