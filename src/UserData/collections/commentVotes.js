// Stores the user's votes on comments in a thread,
// including the "original comment" of the thread.
//
// The vote for the "original comment" of the thread
// is also stored in `threadVotes` collection.
// The rationale is that it's easier to get the votes
// for all threads in a channel using `threadVotes` collection
// rather than iterating over all matching `commentVotes` collection records.
//
// The data from this collection is used when rendering a comment
// to indicate whether the user "has already voted for this comment"
// and whether it was an upvote or a downvote.
//
// Example: `commentVotes/a/123: { '124': 1 }`.
