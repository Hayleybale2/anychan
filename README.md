Modern GUI for imageboards (4chan.org, 8ch.net, 2ch.hk, kohlchan.net, etc).

Based on [`imageboard`](https://github.com/catamphetamine/imageboard) library.

Supported engines:

* [4chan](https://github.com/4chan/4chan-API) ([4chan.org](https://www.4chan.org/)). See [`4chan.org` demo](https://catamphetamine.github.io/captchan/?chan=4chan).
* [vichan](https://github.com/vichan-devel/vichan) ([lainchan.org](https://lainchan.org/), [arisuchan.jp](https://arisuchan.jp/)) / [infinity](https://github.com/ctrlcctrlv/infinity)/[OpenIB](https://github.com/OpenIB/OpenIB/) ([8ch.net](https://8ch.net/)). See: [`8ch.net` demo](https://catamphetamine.github.io/captchan/?chan=8ch), [`lainchan.org` demo](https://catamphetamine.github.io/captchan/?chan=lainchan), [`arisuchan.jp` demo](https://catamphetamine.github.io/captchan/?chan=arisuchan).
* [lynxchan](https://gitgud.io/LynxChan/LynxChan) ([kohlchan.net](https://kohlchan.net), [endchan.xyz](https://endchan.xyz)). See: [`kohlchan.net` demo](https://catamphetamine.github.io/captchan/?chan=kohlchan), [`endchan.xyz` demo](https://catamphetamine.github.io/captchan/?chan=endchan).
* [makaba](https://2ch.hk/api/) ([2ch.hk](https://2ch.hk/)). See [`2ch.hk` demo](https://catamphetamine.github.io/captchan/?chan=2ch).

Don't mind the seemingly slower speed of the demos: the only reason for that is the app can't use chan APIs directly (they don't allow it) and needs to send all HTTP requests through a free public "CORS Proxy" which introduces a delay.

This project currently has only a subset of features. "To do":

  * Add message posting.
  * Add thread watching.
  * Add thread auto-update.
  * Add support for "passes" (`4chan.org`, `2ch.hk`).

<!--
	Miscellaneous:

  * Add comment menu: Hide, Report, Copy Link, View Source, Hide all posts from this author (if `post.id` is available), Expand all images/videos, Run slideshow for all attachments, Open on original website.
	* Maybe add delete post/attachment button. (can delete posts and files without password on 4chan)
	* When text is selected, show "Reply" tooltip for quoting the selected text in a reply.
	* Add post selection from post menu to report several posts in a single report.
	* Format MathML equations on `4chan.org/sci`. Block-level equations: [eqn]f(x_4) = a+2*b[/eqn]. Inline equations: [math]f(x)=\\frac{x^3-x}{(x^2+1)^2}[/math].
-->

## Themes

The app comes pre-packaged with a couple of built-in themes and [allows any degree of customization](https://github.com/catamphetamine/captchan/blob/master/docs/themes/guide.md) via adding custom themes. Each theme has "Light" mode and "Dark" mode.

## Known issues

See [known issues](https://github.com/catamphetamine/imageboard#known-issues) of the `imageboard` library.

The lists of threads/comments are implemented via a "[Virtual Scroller](https://github.com/catamphetamine/virtual-scroller)" which results in great performance boost but at the same time [doesn't support some native in-browser features](https://github.com/catamphetamine/virtual-scroller#search-focus-management) such as "Find on page" or "Tab" key navigation or "screen readers".

## Develop

```
git clone git@github.com:catamphetamine/webapp-frontend.git
git clone git@github.com:catamphetamine/captchan.git
cd captchan
npm install
npm run dev
```

Go to [`http://localhost:1234`](http://localhost:1234)

One may also want to create a [custom configuration file](#configuration). Also check if the [proxy](#proxy) server still works.

## Build

```
git clone git@github.com:catamphetamine/webapp-frontend.git
git clone git@github.com:catamphetamine/captchan.git
cd captchan
npm install
npm run build
```

The build will be output to the `build/assets` directory: `index.html` and a bunch of `.js`/`.css`/`.map`/image files with random generated names (and also about a 100 of code syntax highlighter language plugins that are only loaded on demand at runtime when highlighting a given language in "code" blocks).

Prior to running `npm run build` it's recommended to create a [custom configuration file](#configuration) for enabling advanced features.

## Configuration

It's recommended to create a custom configuration file for enabling features like YouTube video link parsing, Google Analytics, error reporting, etc. By default the application uses `./configuration/default.json` settings file. To define custom settings create a `./configuration/configuration.json` file.

<details>
<summary>Configuration example</summary>

#### configuration.json

```js
{
	// The default chan to use.
	// Can be overridden via a `?chan=` URL parameter.
	// For a built-in chan supply the chan id string.
	// For a custom chan supply a chan info JSON object.
	// See the "chan" directory for the list of built-in chans
	// and use their `index.json` files as an example.
	"chan": "4chan",

	// Google Analytics can be used for tracking page views.
	// Though most users block it in their web browsers.
	"googleAnalytics": {
		"id": "UA-123456789-0"
	},

	// YouTube Data API V3 is used for parsing YouTube links
	// into embedded video attachments having a title and a thumbnail.
	"youtube": {
		// Can be single key or an array of keys in which case
		// a key will be randomly selected from the list on every API request.
		// YouTube has a limit of `1 000 000` API requests per day for a key.
		"apiKey": "TpJTfNAIzaFVteEnl4E-SyCvZRvuuHUZeL3owO8"
	},

	// CORS Proxy settings (see the "Proxy" section of the readme).
	// AWS EC2 is the easiest way to set up a free 1-year proxy.
	"corsProxyUrlAws": "https://example.compute.amazonaws.com/{url}",

	// Chans behind CloudFlare CDN deny access for AWS IP addresses.
	// Such chans can be proxied through Heroku, for example.
	"corsProxyUrl": "https://example.herokuapp.com/{url}",

	// `sentry.io` can be set up to report all client-side errors.
	"sentry.io": {
		"url": "https://1d8af64f618e9b01849237ccbc26e968@sentry.io/1413881"
	},

	// Sometimes chan administration needs to announce something
	// to the users. Things like latest news, contests, etc.
	// See the "Announcements" section below.
	// The URL must be a "same-origin" one (a "relative" URL).
	"announcementUrl": "/announcement.json",

	// Announcement polling interval (in milliseconds).
	// By default it checks for new announcements every hour:
	// 60 * 60 * 1000 = 3600000
	"announcementPollInterval": 3600000,

	// Whether to show GDPR Cookie Notice.
	// Is `false` by default.
	"cookieNotice": true,

	// If `cookiePolicyUrl` is set then a "Learn More" link
	// will be shown in the GDPR Cookie Notice.
	"cookiePolicyUrl": "http://example.com/cookie-policy.html",

	// The maximum length of a thread comment (in "points")
	// until a "Read more"  preview is generated for it.
	// Is `1000` by default.
	"commentLengthLimit": 1000,

	// The maximum length of a thread preview (in "points") on board page
	// until a "Read more"  preview is generated for it.
	// Is `500` by default.
	"commentLengthLimitForThreadPreview": 500
}
```

<details>
<summary>Announcements</summary>

###

Sometimes chan administration needs to announce something to the users. Things like latest news, contests, etc. For that an optional `announcementUrl` configuration parameter exists. For example, if a chan is hosted at `4chan.org` then `announcementUrl` could be `/announcement.json` meaning that the app will periodically try to `GET https://4chan.org/announcement.json`: if the file exists and is not empty then the app will show the announcement â€” a user will be presented with an announcement bar on top of the page. When a user clicks the close (x) button an `announcementRead` cookie is created with the value of the announcement date and so the announcement is no longer shown for this user until there's a new announcement with a different date.

#### announcement.json

```js
{
	// Date in "ISO" format.
	// Could be just a date:
	// date: "2019-07-02"
	// or a date with time:
	date: "2019-07-02T14:37",
	// Announcement content (either a string or an array of strings and objects).
	content: [
		"4chan is now owned and led by ",
		{
			"type": "link",
			"url": "https://twitter.com/hiroyuki_ni",
			"content": "Hiroyuki Nishimura"
		},
		", the founder of the largest anonymous BBS in Japan, 2channel. Read the full announcement on the ",
		{

			"type": "link",
			"url": "https://www.4chan.org/4channews.php",
			"content": "4chan News page"
		},
		"."
	]
}
```

## Adding a new imageboard

First [add the imageboard to `imageboard`](https://github.com/catamphetamine/imageboard#adding-a-new-imageboard) library. Then add the imageboard to `captchan` itself:

* Create the imageboard's directory in `./chan`.
* Create `index.json`, `logo.svg`/`logo.jpg`/`logo.png` and `icon.png` files in the chan's directory (see other chans as an example).
* Add these files for the imageboard in `./src/chans.js` (same as for the existing chans).

## Proxy

All chans (`4chan.org`, `2ch.hk`, etc) don't allow calling their API from other websites by prohibiting [Cross-Origin Resource Sharing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-origin_resource_sharing) (CORS), so a CORS proxy is required in order for another website to be able to query chan API.

A public CORS proxy called ["CORS Anywhere"](https://cors-anywhere.herokuapp.com/) can be used for development/testing. Such public CORS proxy imposes several restrictions such as no support for "cookies" and also introduces an artifical delay for all API requests. There's also some [list of public CORS proxies](https://gist.github.com/jimmywarting/ac1be6ea0297c16c477e17f8fbe51347).

For production deployment a dedicated CORS proxy should be used. A free 1-year AWS EC2 "micro" server could be set up but CloudFlare blocks traffic from AWS EC2 (I guess because it can be easily set up for a DDoS attack) so `4chan.org`, for example, won't work and will return `403 Forbidden` for an AWS EC2 proxy. [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/) seems to work though.

[An example of setting up a free AWS EC2 CORS proxy](https://github.com/catamphetamine/captchan/tree/master/CORS-PROXY.md).

####

In `./configuration/default.json` there's `corsProxyUrl` setting â€” this is the CORS-proxy that will be used for querying chan API. There's also a dedicated `corsProxyUrlAws` setting for chans that don't block AWS yet.
