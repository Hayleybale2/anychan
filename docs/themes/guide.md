# Themes

The application comes pre-packaged with a couple of built-in themes. Users can add their own custom themes on the "Settings" page. For that, a user should supply either a URL of a `.css` file or just paste [CSS](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Learn/CSS/Introduction_to_CSS/How_CSS_works) code.

Themes should mostly use the available [CSS Variables](https://github.com/catamphetamine/captchan/blob/master/docs/themes/variables.md). If a customization can't be achieved using the available CSS Variables consider contacting the repo author through [issues](https://github.com/catamphetamine/captchan/issues) for a discussion of adding new CSS Variables, or just use CSS selectors directly instead.

Each theme should provide both "Light" mode and "Dark" mode.

See the [built-in themes](https://github.com/catamphetamine/captchan/tree/master/src/styles/theme) as an example.
